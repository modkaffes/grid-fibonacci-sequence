# Grid Fibonacci Sequence

## Description

An app that shows a grid of 50Ã—50 cells. When you click on a cell, all values in the cells in the same row and same column are increased by 1 or, if empty, will get a value of 1. After each change, all modified cells will briefly turn yellow.
If 5 consecutive numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are next to each other, these cells will briefly turn green and will be emptied.
